## About this Branch

This branch uses a flask backend to serve a basic html site that uses the OpenAI API to generate speech. Text is generated by the AI that the LangChain AI and then is used as an input to generate text, which is then sent to the client via mp3 url. This mp3 file is audio visualized and played whenever the AI speaks.
